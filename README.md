# Launch Interceptor Program

[![decide-CI](https://github.com/oscarzhpersson/DD2480_Lab1-Decide/actions/workflows/decide-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oscarzhpersson/DD2480_Lab1-Decide/actions/workflows/decide-CI.yml)

This program simulates a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile launch system, through the function `DECIDE()` which return a boolean value. The boolean value represents whether an interceptor should launch or not. The 15 conditions of which is based on within the `DECIDE()` functions are called `Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs)`. If a sufficient set of `LICs` are met the system may initiate a launch, which is the behaviour which this program simulates.
