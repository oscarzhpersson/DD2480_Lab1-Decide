# Launch Interceptor Program

[![decide-CI](https://github.com/oscarzhpersson/DD2480_Lab1-Decide/actions/workflows/decide-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oscarzhpersson/DD2480_Lab1-Decide/actions/workflows/decide-CI.yml)

This program simulates a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile launch system, through the function `DECIDE()` which return a boolean value. The boolean value represents whether an interceptor should launch or not. The 15 conditions of which is based on within the `DECIDE()` functions are called `Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs)`. If a sufficient set of `LICs` are met the system may initiate a launch, which is the behaviour which this program simulates.

# Requirements

The program is built using Python and requires the following packages:

1. ***sympy***
```bash
pip3 install sympy
```
2. ***numpy***
```bash
Requires import only
```
2. ***unittest***
```bash
Requires import only
```

# Usage

The program is built and executed by running:

```bash
python3 main.py

```

Then tested by running:

```bash
python3 modules/test.py

```

Further detailed documentation is provided separately.

# Statement of Contribution

During this project, an effort was put towards distributing the workload equally amongst all members of the team. While some of the specified assignments were largely attributed to one person, a team effort was put into the group assignment, thus a plethora of the features were worked on as a group.
(As a sidenote - Adding any function to the project entails the addition of unit tests as well.)

# What we have done for P+

In order to achieve P+ we have implemented a `Continous Integration (CI)` tool, using GitHub Actions. The tool is run every time someone pushes to or makes a Pull Request towards the main branch. It then runs a linter and our unit tests in order to spot errors within the code (syntax- or runtime errors) but also errors regarding assignment specifications. The tool runs Python 3.10 and Ubuntu Linux.
